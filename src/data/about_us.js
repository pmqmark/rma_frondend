            " The first program organized by the Ruwi Malayalee Association was a social responsibility initiative – a Blood Donation Camp. Based on reports from Oman's national newspapers, it was learned that there was a shortage of blood in the Oman Blood Bank. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the support. The Ruwi Malayalee Association has been actively involved in addressing the social issues faced by expatriates. The association registered its protest regarding the shifting of the NET exam center from the Gulf countries. Similarly, when Air India Express unexpectedly reduced its services, the association strongly protested against the increase in flight charges and the imposition of additional taxes at Thiruvananthapuram Airport."

            " Under the leadership of the Ruwi Malayalee Association, in collaboration with Ruwi Lulu, programs like a children's drawing competition, Iftar feast, and health education classes were organized. The programs were very well attended. Prizes and certificates were distributed to the children who drew the best pictures. Additionally, incentive gifts and certificates were given to all children who participated.",
            "In terms of promoting education, the Ruwi Malayalee Association also made significant interventions. The association visited Yadu Krishna, who was the topper in Oman in the CBSE Plus examination, at his house to pay respects ",
            "Wayanad faced one of the worst natural calamities in Kerala’s history. In response, ദി Ruwi Malayalee Association, along with the Malayalee Association and Oman Mammootty Fans Association, collected funds for relief efforts. We want to extend our gratitude to the Malayali community in Oman, who continue to support us financially and help organize programs. Gulf media, as well as social and online media, play a vital role in bringing attention to the activities of the Malayalee community.",
            "The Ruwi Malayalee Association's family reunion was beautifully organized as a family fest. Members of the community were able to renew relationships and form new friendships, creating artistic opportunities in the process. The association also celebrates Onam, bringing together family members in a joyous and unique celebration from Kerala.On that day, the National Day of the host country was also celebrated. Additionally, the Pravasi Kshemanidhi campaign, organized by the Kerala Government for the welfare of expatriates, was supported by the association "
